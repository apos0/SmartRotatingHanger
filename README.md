## Overview  
Smart Rotating Hanger is an Arduino-based system that automates the rotation of a circular dress hanger. Users can adjust the rotation speed using an encoder, and an OLED screen displays the current RPM.  

## Features  
- Adjustable rotation speed using a rotary encoder  
- Real-time RPM display on an OLED screen  
- Controlled by an **Arduino Nano**  
- Stepper motor-driven rotation for smooth operation  

## Basic Components  
- **Arduino Nano**  
- **Stepper Motor** (42BYGHW804)  
- **Stepper Motor Controller** (DRV8825)  
- **Rotary Encoder**  
- **OLED Display** (GME12864)  
- **12V 6A Power Supply**

## Problems & Notes  
- Unfortunately, the project did not work as intended. The stepper motor was not strong enough to handle the dress's weight.  
- The **DRV8825 driver** overheated after a few minutes. This was patched by adding an **80mm 12V fan** on top of the enclosure box.  
- The stepper motor overheated, likely due to the dressâ€™s inertia on each rotation change.  
- The motor overheating caused the **M5 bolts** on the motor mount to loosen, leading to the mount falling.  

### Conclusion  
A **larger stepper motor** or switching to a **more powerful DC motor** would be required for better performance.
